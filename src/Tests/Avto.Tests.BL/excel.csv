0,One of a kind Money maker! Try it for free! ,"

CONSANTLY being
bombarded by so-called FREE money-making systems that teases you with limited
information, and when its all said and done, blind-sides you by demanding your
money/credit card information upfront in some slick way, after-the-fact!
Yes, I too was as skeptical about such offers and the Internet in general with
all its hype, as you probably are. Fortunate for me, my main business
slowed-down (I have been self-employed all my life), so I looked for
something to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying my
bills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, this
proposal to try something new without any upfront investment (great! because
I had none) interested me to click on the link provided. And I dont regret
at all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you as
a system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You join
only if (when) you make money. You also get to track the results of your
time and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea of
personal control with real-time, staying informed statistics.


This system is quite simply
the most logical, opened, and fair of any others that Ive seen before. Why?
Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriously
consider if this is right for you.  No teasing. No grand testimonies! No
kidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you no idea of
their overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worst
yet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying to
figure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing you
with the two things you really must know: Whats it all about? and How
does it work?. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers that
need to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you dont
want to do that; by then you are hooked and now locked into a frustrating
battle to try to get your money back!


I call this my Platinum
Choice because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totally
different from previously misleading, hook-first programs that promise lofty
mega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their own
pockets! Youve seen the headlines: Join free and Make $10,000 every week
for life yeah, right!


I did not make millions yet,
but the whole thing was launched just a few weeks ago and I am more than happy
with my earnings, so far. I must tell you, I wouldnt be able to do anything
without corporate help  which was unusually thorough, timely, and motivating.


You have to see this in action
for yourself and make up your own mind; just go to my site and fill out the
form as soon as you can. You will get your own site in a few minutes. Then you
are ready to try whether you can make some decent money with this system and
the Internets explosive potential - fully loaded with hi-tech software, free
corporate help, on-time members support and even protective safeguards!


Get it now, and you can call me
at any time with questions. It really could help you like it is helping me to
finally be able to pay my bills, and keep my free time free.  Good luck!

Bonding is not suitable for you because it works too low-level (it is 
layer 2), unless you have two links from the same provider, using some 
technology that can be bonded (like ADSL).

AFAIU what you need is BGP[1], but I can't give you any tips as this is 
way out of my league ;)

Probably a good start (whatever technology you end up using) is a 
GNU/Linux (preferably Debian) machine connected to both internet links 
and your internal network since consumer gateways don't even have more 
than one WAN port[2].

What ""long, rude, unpleasant emails"" have I sent to you? Go ahead,
post everything that I've ever sent to you here. I've sent mails only
as long as the demands of your comments have warranted, filled only
with questions about what is broken for you in KDE 4 and links to bugs
on those very subjects. Rude or unpleasant? I think that you have me
mistaken. I'll give to you the benefit of the doubt, publish something
that you think I wrote to you which is rude or unpleasant.

Which messages exactly? ""last two"" is hard to identify given the

All I did was ask about what issues you have with KDE 4 so that I
might fix them. You don't have to appreciate that, but I do not expect
you to turn it around and call that ""rude and unpleasant"". Maybe you
don't like KDE contributors taking an interest in your problems with
the software. Many other people do.

isn't it ¤250 in Smyths?

don't forget to add to that the modchip, and the time to put it on.

(/me thinks unless you want 3d graphics, www.mini-itx.com is the way to go :))

3k is a number that probably sounds good to some closted  homophobe with
secret desires to be ""belle of the balls"". Twinks dinks and dorks, this

Yes (or at least that's what the manpage says), but only when you have 
the same version of a package.

That's true.  I used to say and think that ... back around 1992 when
I started to use DEC Alpha machines.  But now that 2GB is about as

very real.
